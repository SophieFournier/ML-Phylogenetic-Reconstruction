The question is: Are these two trees the same? In a single output (`TRUE/FALSE`) state whether the trees created below are the same.

Task 1: These trees are not the same

```{r}
a <- read.tree(text = "(a,b,(c,d));")
b <- read.tree(text = "(a,c,(b,d));")
comparePhylo(a, b, plot = TRUE, force.rooted = TRUE)
dist.topo(a, b) == 0
```

Task 2: These trees are not the same

```{r}
#these trees are equivalent
a <- read.tree(text = "(a,c,(b,d));")
b <- read.tree(text = "(a,c,(b,d));")
comparePhylo(a, b, plot = TRUE, force.rooted = TRUE)
dist.topo(a, b) == 0
```

Hint: equivalent trees have 100% of splits in common. You will need to know how many splits there are in each tree. And then, estimate the number of splits in common.
